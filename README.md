# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
A Machine Learning and NLP project that classifies tweets as positive or negative using the Sentiment140 dataset. Preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and various ML models were applied, with Logistic Regression achieving 75.42% accuracy. SVM and Gradient Boosting were explored but skipped due to long computation times.
